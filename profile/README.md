Gwen is a [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) interpreter that helps teams automate end-to-end testing and robotic processing with behaviour described in feature specifications. Automation is achieved through Gherkin bindings called [meta specs](https://gweninterpreter.org/docs/meta), composed with the [Gwen DSL](https://gweninterpreter.org/docs/dsl) and maintained alongside your feature files. An embedded [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) engine executes scenarios according to the meta you provide to perform operations in browsers for you.

All our open source work on Gwen is maintained in the repositories here.
