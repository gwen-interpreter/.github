Gwen project
============

[Gwen](https://gweninterpreter.org/) is a [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) interpreter that helps teams automate end-to-end web testing and robotic processing with behaviour described in feature specifications. All our open source work on Gwen is maintained in the repositories here.
