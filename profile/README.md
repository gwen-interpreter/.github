Gwen project
============

Hi, we are the team who developed and open sourced [Gwen](https://gweninterpreter.org/), a tool for automating acceptance testing and robotic processing with the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) language. All our open source work is maintained in the repositories here.
